\section*{Enhancements}


\begin{enumerate}

\item Describe your enhancement \#1 here
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Brief description of what the enhancement is (if it's a puzzle, also describe what steps the player must take to solve it): 
 
 We enhanced our text adventure game by introducing a new puzzle that requires the player to decipher a code to access a specific location. The player needs to find clues in different locations, gather information, and use it to decode the passcode for a locked area.  Success grants access to the last item in the game.
 
\textbf{Steps to Solve:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The player reaches a location with a Puzzle, represented by the PuzzleLocation class.
            \item The player is prompted to enter a passcode to solve the puzzle.
            \item The player has a limited number of attempts to enter the correct passcode.
            \item If the correct passcode is entered, the player successfully solves the puzzle and gains access to the last item in the game.
        \end{enumerate}

	\item Complexity level (choose from low/medium/high): Medium
 
	\item Reasons you believe this is the complexity level (e.g. mention implementation details, how much code did you have to add/change from the baseline, what challenges did you face, etc.)
 Implementing this enhancement involved moderate complexity. We had to create a new class, \texttt{PuzzleLocation}, that inherits from the \texttt{Location} class but includes an additional attribute \texttt{puzzle\_code}. We also added a new method, \texttt{solve\_puzzle}, to the \texttt{Player} class, allowing the player to attempt to decipher the passcode within a limited number of tries. The complexity increased due to the need for coordinating interactions between the player, and combining pieces of information from different locations.
