You are outside Innis College.
You are outside Innis College on a busy street. There are some students sitting on the benches and others playing frisbee.
It is not winter yet, so flowers are still vibrant and the trees still have most of their leaves. There is a big tree
by the entrance which blocks the sunlight, a perfect spot for a nap!
