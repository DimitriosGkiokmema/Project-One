END

LOCATION 2
This study room is completely empty.
You are in an empty study room. And by empty, we mean, absolutely empty. All the tables and chairs have been taken out,
the whiteboards taken off the wall, not even the carpeting is left. Are they planning to do something else with this space?
END

LOCATION 3
The escalators are devoid of people.
You are at the bottom of the escalators. The escalator going up to the second floor is to the West, the entrance to Robarts 
is to the East. Some of the lights are flickering, and suddenly you get the eerie sense that something is off. It is quiet.
Too quiet. Midterm season is one of the busiest times for libraries, where is everyone?

LOCATION 6
You are at the study room on the second floor of the Robarts Library. The escalators are to the North.
There are a couple people studying, but even more sleeping. You see a table scattered with papers and open books,

You are outside the Robarts library on a crowded street. There is a smell of coffee in the air.

END

LOCATION 8
You are outside Innis College, Robarts is to the South and a tree to the East.
You are outside Innis College on a busy street. There are some students sitting on the benches and others playing frisbee
on the grass. It is not winter yet, so flowers are still vibrant and the trees still have most of their leaves. There is 
a big tree West of the entrance which blocks the sunlight, a perfect spot for a nap! Robarts is to the South.
END

LOCATION 9
You are under a tree by the entrance of Innis College. The entrance to Innis is to the West.
Because of your superior tree skills, you can quickly tell that the tree is an Oak Tree, which can live up to one thousand years!
On the grass behind the tree you notice something red. What could it be? The entrance to Innis is the West.
